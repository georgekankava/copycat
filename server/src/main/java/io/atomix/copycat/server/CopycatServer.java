/**
 * Provides a standalone implementation of the <a href="http://raft.github.io/">Raft consensus algorithm</a>.
 * <p>
 * To create a new server, use the server {@link CopycatServer.Builder}. Servers require
 * cluster membership information in order to perform communication. Each server must be provided a local {@link Address}
 * to which to bind the internal {@link io.atomix.catalyst.transport.Server} and a set of addresses for other members in
 * the cluster.
 * <p>
 * Underlying each server is a {@link StateMachine}. The state machine is responsible for maintaining the state with
 * relation to {@link Command}s and {@link Query}s submitted to the
 * server by a client.
 * <pre>
 *   {@code
 *   Address address = new Address("123.456.789.0", 5000);
 *   Collection<Address> members = Arrays.asList(new Address("123.456.789.1", 5000), new Address("123.456.789.2", 5000));
 *
 *   CopycatServer server = CopycatServer.builder(address, members)
 *     .withStateMachine(new MyStateMachine())
 *     .build();
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * Server state machines are responsible for registering {@link Command}s which can be submitted
 * to the cluster. Raft relies upon determinism to ensure consistency throughout the cluster, so <em>it is imperative
 * that each server in a cluster have the same state machine with the same commands.</em>
 * <p>
 * By default, the server will use the {@code NettyTransport} for communication. You can configure the transport via
 * {@link CopycatServer.Builder#withTransport(Transport)}.
 * <p>
 * As {@link Command}s are received by the server, they're written to the Raft {@link Log}
 * and replicated to other members of the cluster. By default, the log is stored on disk, but users can override the default
 * {@link Storage} configuration via {@link CopycatServer.Builder#withStorage(Storage)}. Most notably,
 * to configure the storage module to store entries in memory instead of disk, configure the
 * {@link StorageLevel}.
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * CopycatServer server = CopycatServer.builder(address, members)
 *   .withStateMachine(new MyStateMachine())
 *   .withStorage(new Storage(StorageLevel.MEMORY))
 *   .build();
 * }
 * </pre>
 * All serialization is performed with a Catalyst {@link Serializer}. By default, the serializer loads registered
 * {@link io.atomix.catalyst.serializer.CatalystSerializable} types with {@link ServiceLoaderTypeResolver}, but users
 * can provide a custom serializer via {@link CopycatServer.Builder#withSerializer(Serializer)}.
 * The server will still ensure that internal serializable types are properly registered on user-provided serializers.
 * <p>
 * Once the server has been created, to connect to a cluster simply {@link #open()} the server. The server API is
 * fully asynchronous and relies on {@link CompletableFuture} to provide promises:
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * server.open().thenRun(() -> {
 *   System.out.println("Server started successfully!");
 * });
 * }
 * </pre>
 * When the server is started, it will attempt to connect to an existing cluster. If the server cannot find any
 * existing members, it will attempt to form its own cluster.
 * <p>
 * Once the server is started, it will communicate with the rest of the nodes in the cluster, periodically
 * transitioning between states. Users can listen for state transitions via {@link #onStateChange(Consumer)}:
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * server.onStateChange(state -> {
 *   if (state == CopycatServer.State.LEADER) {
 *     System.out.println("Server elected leader!");
 *   }
 * });
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * @see StateMachine
 * @see Transport
 * @see Storage
